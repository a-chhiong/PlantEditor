1.  **Core Framework**: [Lit Element](https://lit.dev/) for fast, lightweight custom components.
2.  **Styles**: Vanilla CSS utilizing custom variables, container queries, and backdrop blur filters.
3.  **Layout Engine**: Graphviz WebAssembly (`viz-global.js`).
4.  **UML Compiler**: Compiled Java-to-JS PlantUML (`plantuml.js`).
5.  **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for quick development starts and optimized, lightweight build output.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

Start the Vite local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Any edits to components or styles will hot-reload automatically.

### Production Build

To compile and optimize the editor for production (e.g. for GitHub Pages deployment):

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled assets, along with static Graphviz/PlantUML engines, will be outputted to the `dist/` directory.

### Previewing Production Build

To test the compiled production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 📦 GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is fully static and configured to deploy to GitHub Pages. 

To host the workspace on GitHub Pages:
1. Ensure your Vite configuration is set with the correct base path (usually `./` or the repo name).
2. Commit the `dist` folder or set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run the build and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch.
